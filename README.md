## Welcome PLCT Lab Blogs!

For our staff, graduates, and interns:
- This repo is hosting English blogs only. Chinese blogs should PR to [PLCT-Weekly](https://github.com/isrc-cas/PLCT-Weekly).
- Do not write contents in this README file. Always create a new markdown file for your article.
- ALL file path should not be moved or renamed. We need to keep all links available in future 10 years.
- ALL filenames should be ASCII w/o spaces.
- feel free to create new subfolder if you have a series of blogs to write.

If you have questions or sugguests, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/plctlab/plctlab.github.io/issues).
